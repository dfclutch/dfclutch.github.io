			<div class="content">At Ohio State, I am studying Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in the theoretical side of computer science, rather than the software-engineering focused side. Algorithms and math are generally where I feel most comfortable. Some of my favorite course include:
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>CSE2321 - Discrete Structures:</em> My first introduction to Graphs, Proofs, Set Theory, etc.
					<li><em>CSE3321 - Finite Automata and Formal Languages:</em> One of the highest level theory classes in the OSU undergrad sequence - a class on computability theory and its associated mathematics
					<li><em>CSE5526 - Neural Networks:</em> Taught by DeLiang Wang, director of the Ohio State Perception and Neurodynamics lab, Neural Networks is probably the most interesting and engaging class I've taken at OSU
				</ul>
				<br>
				While I enjoy theoretical computer science mostly, I feel I am a mature programmer and software designer. My education outside of class - through internships and personal study - has made me an excellent writer of clean, readable, maintainable code. The most valuable thing I took away from my Summer 2019 internship with John Deere was a practical sense of how and why writing beautiful code is necessary.

			<div class="content">The middle child of three boys, I grew up in Gettysburg, a rural town along the appalachian mountians in southern Pennsylvania. Few things are as important to me as spending time alone outside. I enjoy long distance running and will nerd out over ultralight backpacking gear for hours (check out my <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/73c46t" class="in-text" target="_blank"> lighterpack</a>). Aside from walking and running in the woods, music has been a long-term passion of mine. I studied classical guitar for several years, along with a host of other instruments such as cello, piano, and saxophone. Other hobbies of mine include drawing and painting, cooking, searching for the ultimate <a href="http://www.oylersorganicfarms.com/certified-organic-apple-cider" class="in-text" target="_blank">apple cider</a>, and looking at maps.
