        <div class="content">At Ohio State, I am studying Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in
            Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in the theoretical side of computer science, rather than the
            software-engineering focused side. Algorithms and math are generally where I feel most comfortable. Some of
            my favorite courses I have taken so far include:
            <div class="pullout">
                <ul>
                    <li><em><strong>CSE2321</strong> - Foundations I - Discrete Structures:</em> First in a 2-course sequence covering
                        Graphs, Proofs, Set Theory, Complexity Analysis etc.
                        <br></li>
                    <li><em><strong>CSE3321</strong> - Finite Automata and Formal Languages:</em> An additional theory course for
                        students who enjoyed the foundations sequence - a class on formal languages, computational
                        models and ultimately computability theory and its associated mathematics
                    <br></li>
                    <li><em><strong>CSE5526</strong> - Neural Networks:</em> A low-level look at Neural Networks and their
                        implementation, we get to implement full networks from scratch - no libraries. Neural Networks
                        is probably the most interesting and engaging class I've taken at OSU.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                While I enjoy theoretical computer science mostly, I feel I am a mature programmer and software
                designer. My education outside of class - through internships and personal study - has made me an
                excellent writer of clean, readable, maintainable code. The most valuable thing I took away from my
                Summer 2019 internship with John Deere was a practical sense of how and why writing beautiful code is
                necessary. As a grader for the CSE department, I have spent a lot of time looking at and debugging code
                written by students who are just learning to code for the first time. That experience has been valuable
                in improving my own skills. I take writing code - and everything that comes with it (documentation,
                version control etiquette, etc.) very seriously.

        <div class="content">The middle child of three boys, I grew up in Gettysburg, a rural town along the appalachian
            mountians in southern Pennsylvania. Few things are as important to me as spending time alone outside. I
            enjoy long distance running and will nerd out over ultralight backpacking gear for hours (check out my <a

            from walking and running in the woods, music has been a long-term passion of mine. I studied classical
            guitar for several years, along with a host of other instruments such as cello, piano, and saxophone. Other
            hobbies of mine include drawing and painting, cooking, searching for the ultimate <a
