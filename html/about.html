			<div class="page-title">Introduction</div>
			<div class="content">Pennsylvania native studying Computer Science Engineering at The Ohio State University. On a mission to become the most versatile, fullstack developer that I can be. Interested in data analysis, GIS, and machine learning industries. Originally from the small, historic town of Gettysburg.

			<div class="page-title">Education</div>
			<div class="content">My studies at Ohio State have focused mainly on learning the fundamental concepts of computer science. These include object-oriented programming techniques, data structures, proper documentation,  low-level programming, version control techniques, automated testing, and efficient algorithm design. The CSE department at Ohio State produces students who can ground-up build applications and systems that are easily maintained, well organized, and self-explanatory. Outside of my studies in the computer science department, Statistics has been a significant portion of my education. I have taken statistics courses covering inference and testing, spatial statistical methods, non-parametric testing, regression, dimensionality-reduction, and feature extraction. In my free time, I enjoy developing my front-end development skills, both in web and standalone application use cases. Building instantly comfortable and self-guiding interfaces is a central goal when I approach building an application. Because I like to consider myself and engineer first, I focus on learning about software development strategies and continually improving performance and efficiency.

			<div class="page-title">Personal</div>
			<div class="content">The middle child of three boys, I grew up around farms and orchards in rural southern PA. Few things are as important to me as spending time alone outside. I enjoy long distance running and will nerd out over ultralight backpacking gear for hours (check out my <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/6pw8l" class="in-text" target="_blank"> lighterpack</a>). Aside from walking and running in the woods, music has been a long-term passion of mine. I studied classical guitar for several years, along with a host of other instruments such as cello, piano, and saxophone. Other hobbies of mine include drawing and painting, cooking, searching for the ultimate apple cider, and looking at maps.
