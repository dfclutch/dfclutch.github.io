						<div class="picture-list-title">20. Cocoa Sugar - Young Fathers</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Young Fathers have been making top quality, slightly out-there rap music for a few years now and this acts as a great addition to their discography. It's the kind of music you can throw on during a social situation and you might get a few weird looks, but likely more people asking you "Who is this??"

						<div class="picture-list-title">19. Everything's Fine - Jean Grae, Quelle Chris</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Quirky and quick-witted, this album is painfully accurate in its description of the world in 2018. Both Grae and Quelle Chris are at the top of their game here.

					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						This is basically what every emo-tinged, bandcamp-based, sad teenage band should be aspiring to. Both groups work in concert to produce an excellent and cohesive dual-album while they capture the sadness of life and change and growth.

					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						It's good jazz in 2018. Something we needed. At times experimental and avante-garde, but not distracting or abrasive - not that I mind either of those things - but it's definitely approachable to someone who might not go for say Brotzmann

					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">

					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						This album is transporting, one of the most other worldly sounding albums I've listened to all year. It begs the question "did a human REALLY make this?"

						<div class="picture-list-title">11. Warm - Jeff Tweedy</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Warm sits perfectly within Tweedy's discography.It makes me want to listen to some Uncle Tupelo or Wilco or Son Volt in the best way possible.

					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						I'm not a person who hears the word "Tropical" and thinks positively, in fact, I'd prefer it to be 10&#176; Than 85&#176;. This album is an anomoly for me in that respect. It's strikingly beautiful in both instrumentation and vocal performance. It resonates with me for many of the same reasons that other religious music does - there's a tangible spiritual connection between the artist and the product.

						<div class="picture-list-title">9. Age Of - Oneohtrix Point Never</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Certainly Lopatin's most accessible venture to date, he doesn't sacrifice gripping textures, melodies, and percussion for listenability. This album takes you places you're not really sure you want to go to. Shortly after it came out I had the aux at a friend's house and asked if he wanted to feel "anxious" and put this on because that's certainly what it feels like. The album embracess a more user-friendly song structure, including elements like cohesive rythms, bass lines that repeat over 8-bars, and Lopatin's own vocals (though heavily modified) for the first time on a OPN project. This album acts as both an entry point for those unfamiliar to Oneohtrix Point Never and a fantastic addition to his library.

						<div class="picture-list-title">8. In Another Life - Sandro Perri</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						This is a pop album that takes its approach to song structure from ambient, with teh first track extending over 24 minutes of mildly varying, warm, hopeful pop. As much attention and patience as this album demands, it never detracts from it's listenability. It's is enjoyable throughout and it bubbles from verse to verse, it's details lie in its subtlety. Help from Dan Bejar on the last track stands out as a high point for me. Don't let the 4 track listing trick you into thinking this album is a 15 minute EP, it's an excursion through luxurious pop.

						<div class="picture-list-title">7. Your Queen is a Reptile - Sons of Kemet</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Sons of Kemet put together a set of raw afro-jazz tracks displaying both technical prowess, varied composition, and musicality. YQiaR is powerful, with strong sax lines over an urgent percussion section providing a baseline for intensely varied soloing efforts. The record is dark at times and bursts forward at others, occasionally taking a soothing, more relaxed perspective.

						<div class="picture-list-title">6. Pinegrove - Skylight</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Oh, Pinegrove. After a year-long hiatus from touring or releasing music, Evan Hall and Co. come out with an album that, while doesn't reach the same raw heights as 2016's Cardinal, contains more of the 90's alt-country infused emo-ish indie that I fell in love with. Evan is a writer that thoroughly understands how to create feelings for the listener. His vocal performances pair perfectly with his song writing, sqwaking and breaking his voice over insightful lyrics about love, life, and home.

						<div class="picture-list-title">5. Avantdale Bowling Club - Avantdale Bowling Club</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						A Jazz Rap album that doesn't put me to sleep! An excellent combination of well-produced, heavily jazz influenced instrumentals with well-written lyricism that doesn't sound like it's trying too hard. This is an album that interfaces between jazz and hip hop in a way that makes them feel connected, not disparate. Tom Scott avoids many of the pitfalls his compatriots fall into.

						<div class="picture-list-title">4. Songs of the Plains - Colter Wall</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						The harshest criticism I've seen of Songs of the Plains has been that it's stuck in the past. Being honest, this album sounds about 60 years old. However, the level of execution seen here makes this the best country album since Magnolia Electric Co. Wall sings of a life in Canada many who live in less rural areas don't even consider the existance of - something I think is central to country music. Mark my words, Colter is going to be a legend.

						<div class="picture-list-title">3. Some Rap Songs - Earl Sweatshirt</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						One of only a few rap albums I listened to this year that I immediately knew would stick with me. Earl has been one of my favorite rappers for years, this mix of Dilla and Madlib influences was exactly what I wanted to listen to.

						<div class="picture-list-title">2. Wide Awake! - Parquet Courts</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						Wike awake is an album I would describe as woke. Abrasive, hostile, and savvy. Parquet Courts frontman, Andrew Savage, said he set out to make a punk album you could put on at a party and it does just that. It accomplishes everything it can, and to me, that is the measure of a great record.

						<div class="picture-list-title">1. Twin Fantasy - Car Seat Headrest</div>
					</div>
					<p class="picture-list-text">
						While I almost feel it shouldn't count, because the material on this record is 7 years old, this album is nearly perfect. It's self referential, biting, introspective, witty, and immature at times. Will Toledo wrote an exciting and resonant set of songs here that I probably didn't go more than a week without listening to for the majority of the year. It's a record that's already stood up to 7 years, and I think will stay important for the low-fi scene for years to come.
