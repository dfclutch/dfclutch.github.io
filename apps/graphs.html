        <h2>Learning Corner</h2>
        <p><em><strong>Implementation:</strong></em></p>
        <p>
            This app is written in front-end only JavaScript. All animations are created live based on the state of the
            controller settings. This extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_client" class="in_text">thick
            client</a>
            design was chosen for a few reasons:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>I can host static sites with front-end JS for free on github pages</li>
            <li>Easier to implement instead of trying to maintain both a UI and Server codebase</li>
            <li>Makes the app more responsive</li>
        </ul>
        The code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/dfclutch/dfclutch.github.io" class="in_text">here</a>. In
        short, the app relies on a central state object that is updated whenever the sliders/radio buttons are changed -
        much like the pattern used in Redux applications. The graph is represented as an object with an <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix" class="in_text"><em>Adjacency Matrix</em></a> to model
        the graph structure, and arrays of Node and Edge objects to represent the literal expression of the graph. Each
        animation
        is tied to a function which populates Frames, a property of the state, with many Graph objects, each colored
        (and eventually text-ed) differently to represent each step of the algorithm. When the animation is run, the
        Frames object is populated completely first, and then each Graph gets drawn with a certain amount of time in
        between each redraw.
        <p><em><strong>Search:</strong></em></p>
        <p>
            The first algorithms animations implemented on this site are basic <em><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" class="in_text">Breadth First Search</a></em>
            and <em><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" class="in_text">Depth First Search</a></em>.
            These are the two
            most common algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graph_traversal" class="in_text"><em>graph
            searching</em></a>. The algorithms start from an initial position (the root of the tree, or a random node in
            the simple graph) and searches for the goal node, marked in red. When watching the algorithm run some
            interesting properties can be observed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithms behave differently depending on the situation they are searching. For example, if the node is
            in the first half of the bottom row of the tree, DFS will search significantly fewer nodes (marked in green
            after being visited) than BFS. Though if you animate the algorithm on the random undirected graph - which
            includes both cycles and much greater "depth" than the trees, BFS will generally take longer, though the
            eventual path to the goal node will often be <b>much</b> shorter than that of DFS.
        </p>
        <p>
            The differences between the behavior (which can be formally expressed in part by analyzing their asymptotic
            time and space complexity, see the linked articles above) make deciding between the two algorithms a
            critical choice when they are used in application. Graph traversal is a key part of many algorithms for
            things like web searching, network analysis, artificial intelligence, etc.

        <p><em><strong>Minimal Spanning Tree:</strong></em> ([beta] if it crashes, sorry!)</p>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree" class="in_text">Minimal (or minimum)
            Spanning Tree</a> is the set of edges within a graph that represents the lowest possible cumulative <em>weight</em>
            to connect all vertices within the graph without cycles. Here, an edge's weight is the length of the edge,
            for visual simplicity. In other words, the minimal spanning tree I draw here uses the least amount of ink
            to connect all the dots while only drawing on the graph's edges. As somewhat of an intuition for proving the
            minimality of the generated tree, I have included in the text output the weight of the spanning tree and the
            total weight of the graph's edges. Notice that when running the algorithm repeatedly on the same graph, even
            when starting from different points, the minimal weight is the same. While not a proof of the minimality, it
            suggests that there are no cheaper ways to traverse the graph. This in turn shows that for any graph with
            unique edge weights, there is exactly 1 minimum spanning tree. This is most likely the case for any graph
            you generate on this site, as the likelihood of two nodes being the exact same distance apart is pretty low.
        </p>
        <p>
            To find the Minimal Spanning Tree, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm"
                                                        class="in_text"><em>Prim's Algorithm.</em></a> Prim's is the
            simplest algorithm for finding minimal spanning trees, though with limitations. For example, if you run the
            animation with a low graph density, you may notice some nodes are not colored. This results from the graph
            not being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)" class="in_text">connected.</a>
            A solution would be to run the algorithm until a minimal spanning tree is created for a given connected
            component of the graph, selected a new node NOT within the MST, and repeat the process until all nodes are
            part of an MST, creating a Minimal Spanning Forest. A more elegant solution to the non-connected graph
            problem is using something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm"
                                               class="in_text">Kruskal's Algorithm.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Euclidean Minimal Spanning Tree takes the idea of an MST and discards the constraint of following only
            the existing edges of the graph. Instead, it will draw its own connections, choosing the absolute minimum
            path connecting all nodes. This is equivalent to constructing an MST on a complete graph where the edge
            weight is the length - and that is the implementation I used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The applications of finding the Minimal Spanning Tree on a graph are highly varied. Things like process
            optimization e.g. figuring out the best routes for delivery truck drivers, or the optimal circuit path when
            designing an electrical component. As with most graph theory problems, the applications go far beyond what
            you might expect including ecotoxicology, taxonomy, and financial analysis.
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>Nice Graphs:</strong></em></p>
        <p>
            A long standing problem with this site has been producing random graphs that are structured such that the
            intuition for what each algorithm does is clear. I refer to this as the "Nice" Graph Problem. Because there
            is no definition for niceness, I have implemented an algorithm for generating graphs that at least look
            somewhat organized. I call the current implementation <em>soft k-nearest neighbor.</em> This implementation
            connects each node to <em>k</em> nearby nodes, however, they are not necessarily the closest <em>k</em>
            nodes. Instead, the <em>k * 1.5</em> nearest are found and then a random <em>k</em> subset of those nearby
            nodes are selected. This produces graphs that are generally clustered by proximity but includes some
            variation for visual interest.
