An Animator Function takes a graph representation (stored in state.graph) an populates state.frames with node and edge
sets as well as colorings to be animated by the graphics engine. For example, a tree bfs animator will choose a starting
and ending node and search the tree for it, adding different nodes and edges to sets as it goes.
