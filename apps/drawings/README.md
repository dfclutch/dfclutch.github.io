# Static Site Template

My (better) version of create-react-app.

Why is it better?
- More transparent dependencies (babel, webpack)
- Uses much cooler `() => {}` syntax for functional components

## Tech Stack: 
  - React
  - Styled components

## Cloning Template:

  1. Copy and paste entire directory
  2. Ensure nodejs is installed and in your path, matching the version listed in `.nvmrc`
  3. run `npm install` to install dependencies
  4. run `npm run build` to run a production build of the project
  5. open `index.html` to view the output page
  7. run `npm run dev` for a quicker build and automatic rebuilding (requires refreshing browser to see changes)
