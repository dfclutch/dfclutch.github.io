				<div class="content">
				A web app built to assist in the collection of entomological data for the Penn State Fruit Research Extension Center. The goal of the application is to streamline the process of data collection, processing, and entering. To do so, the simple format allows the user to enter data directly into the application, in this case in three categories. A new entry page is available for each of the repetitions of the experiment it was built for. When all the data has been entered into the app, submitting the form automatically uploads the data as a CSV file to an online storage location. This means that the data, which was previously recorded on paper data sheets and then entered by hand, can be seamlessly added to all previous data from the extent of the experiment.<p>

				<div class="content">
				A desktop application for hosting often-used calculations for my mechanical and chemical engineering friends. The app was built as an exercise in both GUI design as well as Python. Prior to building the toolkit, I was still fairly new to the language. The app groups calculations into Math, Physics, or Chemistry categories and includes a favorites menu. It's backend is based on a widget object created with a <code>calc()</code> function, so all widgets can be built and easily evaluated in the same way. Python's variable argument capabilities meant that a variable number of inputs to each calculation was easy to manage. The project has allowed me to explore Version Control Software in an environment outside the classroom, where my friends and I were able to apply what we've learned, from algorithm writing to software development strategies, in a real-life context.<p>
