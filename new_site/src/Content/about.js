                <p>
                    I love working in JavaScript. In my personal work, I build webapps with the MERN stack. The
                    Functional Programming and Object-as-datastructure features in particular make JavaScript my
                    favorite language. I have started to dip my toes into TypeScript as a method of organization, but
                    for fast development, I find JS extremely useful. I am a follower of the Robert C. Martin Clean Code
                    philosophy, and approach writing software with professionalism, maintainability, and extensibility
                    in mind. Also within computer science I study network science, particularly network visualization
                    and spectral graph theory. My specialization at OSU is in Artificial Intelligence. I have taken
                    classes on many sub-fields within AI though I most enjoyed studying Neural Networks with one of
                    OSU's top researching Professors, <a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/">Prof. Deliang
                    Wang.</a>

                    Beyond Computer Science I have a ridiculous number of Hobbies. I invest a large amount of time and
                    money into ultralight backpacking, <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/73c46t">here is my
                    lighterpack.</a> To go along with long distance hiking, I've been a runner for most of my life I
                    also am a specialty coffee drinker and daily home-espresso maker. I use a manual espresso press and
                    grinder, and I prefer Ethiopian natural process coffees. I play a host of musical instruments,
                    mostly guitar, where I study the <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/American+Primitivism/">American
                    Primitivism style.</a> "I've always been passionate about Art and Design. I draw every day, and if I
                    weren't a software engineer, I would want to be a furniture designer. The biggest reason I am
                    looking to be a front-end engineer is because it allows me to flex both my creative and technical
                    skills.
