      <h1>Recreation in the Michaux State Forest</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>
        The Michaux (mih-SHOW) State Forest is an 85,000 acre area covering the majority of South Mountain in Pennsylvania. The Michaux is culturally, historically, and geographically important. It is filled with cultural resources including remnents of the iron and logging industries. There are several iron furnaces preserved, most visibly in Caledonia and Pine Grove Furnace state parks. The Michaux is home to Penn State Mont Alto Campus, one of the finest and oldest forestry schools in the country. Because of this, there are ongoing forestry experiments, which is why you often find dense pine plantations sharply divided from hardwood forests, and seemingly random fences (used to test the growth of trees without the presence of deer and bears). As with all the state forests, the Michaux is a "working forest", it is actively logged and used for other various environmental resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        South Mountain (poorly named) represents the northern terminus of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a 600 mile chain which include the Smokies and the Shenandoah. South Mountain itself stretches from Dillsburg, PA south to the Potomac River near Harpers Ferry. The Blue Ridge is the eastern portion of the Appalachians and is separated from the rest of the Appalachians by a wide valley, known in general as the Great Appalachian Valley. South Mountain specifically is bordered to the west by Cumberland and Hagerstown Valleys, though the Great Valley extends south (including the Shenandoah Valley) to Alabama and north into Canada. The Blue Ridge is distinct from the rest of the Appalachians in both geography/topology and culture. The western portions of the Appalachians is made up of north-south oriented ridge and valley formations. The Blue Ridge, however, contains shorter ridges at varied angles and more triangular peaks. The Blue Ridge is the heart of Appalachian culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        South Mountain forms a hook shape centered around Gettysburg along the borders of Adams, Franklin, and Cumberland counties. During the Civil War, the Confederate army used the Blue Ridge as a screen on their campaign north, disguising their movements from the Union. After the northern terminus at South Mountain, they would lose this screen. This was one of the driving causes that pushed the Confederates east into Gettysburg (as well as promises of manufacturing facilities to raid), causing the famous battle. The Michaux contained a World War 2 prisoner of war camp called Camp Michaux at the base of Little Rocky Ridge and Big Hill, outside Pine Grove Furnace. The camp was a secret to the public until the '90s and was a holding and interrogation site for Japanese and German officers. Only ruins remain, though writing in concrete structures, and several decorative elements are interesting attractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state forest service offers many recreation opportunities such as hiking, wilderness backpacking, water sports like kayaking, mountain biking, hunting, etc. Backpacking is extremely easy because of the dense trail network and excellent map availability. Camping is permitted anywhere in the forest (200' away from water, and you cannot stay more than one night in a spot without a free permit). There are many excellent already established campsites that should be used if possible to avoid damaging habitat. The Appalachian Trail runs 36 miles through the forest and provides an excellent central route north-south. The halfway point of the entire trail (1100 miles from Springer Mtn., Georgia and Mt. Katahdin, Maine) is contained in the forest near Pine Grove Furnace.

      <h2>DAY HIKES</h2>
      <a href="https://caltopo.com/m/SKCR" target="_blank">CalTopo Map</a>
      <p>
        The map linked above is created with a webapp called CalTopo. It is an incredibly useful application for making maps, especially of backcountry trails. The routes are made up of several subsections, generally split where trails start and end. The colors of the headings for each trail match the associated trail in CalTopo but do NOT match the blazed colors in the forest. The graph icon next to the name of each section (in the left panel) shows terrain statistics, distance, etc. Moving your mouse over the elevation line in the terrain profile will show where that point is on the trail.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to do these hikes is to get a decent map, preferably on paper, and reference it often. The public use maps are available free at various locations throughout the park, but most easily at the forest service headquarters on Route 30 outside Caledonia. The Purple lizard maps are far more detailed, durable, and contain many trails not marked on the DCNR map. Either way, there are countless unmarked deviations in the forest that can and will trip you up, so pay attention to when you are supposed to be climbing, descending, facing a certain direction, etc. The best way to ensure not getting lost is to download The Hiking Project app, download the PA trails pack, and view the area you are hiking up close in the app before you lose service (to cache the maps on your phone so they are still visible when you have no internet). Your phone GPS works without service and is <em>usually</em> accurate.

        <h3 style="color: orange">ROCKY KNOB TRAIL</h3> (4 mi):<br>
          <div class="trail-description">
            <h3>Parking:</h3> Either on Birch Run road at the northern tip of Long Pine Run Reservoir or on Ridge Road. I suggest birch run, though that lot is generally more crowded, the south connector trail is more interesting.
            <br>
            <h3>Route:</h3> Starting from the south connector trailhead, you begin at the confluence of Birch Run (heading north east) and Knob Run (heading northwest), immediately before their outlet into Long Pine Run Reservoir. The South connector trail follows Knob Run up the valley between Rocky Knob to the right and Mitten and Wolf hill to the left. As you climb, Rocky Knob's Steep southwestern face exhibits a large glaciated boulder field. It is possible to summit rocky knob easily, however any trails there have been closed due to an abundance of rattlesnakes. The summit is small and, well rocky. The south connector meets the Rocky Knob Loop, the main section of the hike. This loop (going counter clockwise from 6-o'clock) traverses over Sier Hill, the second higest peak in Adams County, and exhibits a few distinct vistas, most interestingly looking back over rocky knob and the reservoir nearly 700' below. The north connector is a bit shorter, and fairly boring, though it crosses the Appalachian trail and is a good connection for longer hikes. The trail is covered mostly with hardwood forests, though the beginning of the south connector is heavily coniferous, there are dense rhododendron tunnels throughout.

      <p>
        <h3 style="color: red">ASTRO-CANADA</h3> (8.5 mi):<br>
          <div class="trail-description">
            <h3>Parking:</h3> There are two places to park, both on Ridge Road. I suggest parking at the parking area #2 on the associated map, it is a large multi-way intersection that has plenty of room to park. The fegley road intersection is arguably a better way to do the hike but there is occasional logging I've seen in the area and only room to pull off for one car.
            <br>
            <h3>Route:</h3> Starting from the Fegley Road intersection, the route begins on Fegley Road, an old  haul road that is mostly just a grass path. The road meets a 4-way intersection with one of the corners cut and a bit of a clearing that can be confusing. The beginning of Astronomy Trail is marked with a post and the trail is blazed in red. The first turn can be hidden so if you stop seeing red blazes or continue on a road instead of trail, turn back and make sure you're going the right way. Astronomy trail traverses a narrow two mile ridge that extends northwest pointing toward Cumberland Valley, with Reservoir Hollow to the left and Thompson Hollow to the right. The views from Astronomy ridge are pretty good, no wide open vistas, but Midnight Ridge is sharp and craggy to the right and Cumberland Valley begins to open up in front. The trail concludes with a short but steep descent of about 400' vertical. Make a left turn and walk gradually uphill on the gravel Milesburn Road for about 3/4 of a mile. Canada Hollow road and trail connect to the right at a small bridge over a creek. Either the road or the trail will bring you to where you need to go but the trail is much more exciting. The climb up Canada hollow is fairly arduous, and the trail can be ambiguous with several forks that are unmarked. I suggest using a phone app (Hiking Project) with GPS to guess at which forks to take and just try to shoot for the many-way intersection of Milesburn and Ridge roads with the AT. The steepest part of the trail is on a fairly wide logging road, as you leave Canada Hollow you emerge into an open, recently logged section that provides great views of Cumberland Valley to the west and the surrounding Hollows. Once you reach the intersection, you take the AT north, down a sharp descent, and past Milesburn Cabin (there is a potable spring marked in blue near the cabin). The AT continues up the northern face of Big Flat Ridge through dense pine plantations. Eventually, you meet Fegley road again at a powerline cut through. Take a left and meet back up with the car.

        <h3 style="color: deepskyblue">VISTA-CANYON-BUCK RIDGE</h3> (9-9.4 mi):<br>
          <div class="trail-description">
            <h3>Parking:</h3> Either park near Fuller Lake or Laurel Lake in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. There is plenty of parking at both. Near Fuller lake is the Pine Grove General Store (I believe cash only). The general store hosts the "Half Gallon Challenge", because the state park represents the halfway point of the Appalachian trail, hikers are challenged to eat a half gallon of ice cream. They have food, it's okay for a general store in the middle of nowhere. 
            <br>
            <h3>Route:</h3> Beginning at the Laurel Lake parking lot: cross PA233/Pine Grove Road to Cold Springs Road, then turn right on Moutain Creek road. follow mountain creek road for about 3/4 of a mile. It will make a large C-shaped bend, at the top of the "C" an unmarked trail ascends along a rocky ridge. This trail has several forks that are not marked, again using Hiking Project or the Purple Lizard Map will help. If you start descending, you are probably going the wrong direction. After less than a mile the trail flattens out a bit but is still generally uphill. The first unnamed vista (simply reffered to as Vista), is about 3/4 of a mile from leaving Mountain Creek road in a copse of pitch pine (the pine trees which grow twisty and flattened). This vista looks south west over Mountain Creek Valley. Little Rocky Ridge is the smaller ridge visible in the distance in front of Big Hill which is cut on the northern end by a sharp pass. Along the trail note the almond shaped, 20' long sections where the trail splits in two and rejoins itself. These are for mountain bikers who need to get off the trail to patch tires, pass each other, etc. These are trails made by mountain bikers, so respect them if you see them. After the first vista, you will pass two right hand turns/forks. There is another vista known as Canyon which is reachable via either of these forks. It looks north up Mountain Creek valley and is less impressive. A loop goes from the first fork to the second, though it is possible to skip by just continuing on the original unnamed trail. Eventually the trail hits a grass road, turn left here and hit a gravel road - Cold Spring road. It is a pretty good road walk down past some beautiful cabins if you want to call it early. Directly across Cold Spring is the beginning of Buck Ridge Trail. This heads south west along the base of buck ridge toward Little Rocky Ridge. After about 3.4 miles, the trail hits PA233/Centerville Road. Here you must carefully cross that and Pine Grove Road again. The Fuller Lake/PGF General store area is at this intersection. To get back to Laurel Lake, there are a few options including the gravel/paved (and difficult to say) Old Railroad Bed Road, or Mountain Creek Trail. Pick up a map of PGFSP as a souvenier and a guide to get back to the car, about 3 miles away.

        <h3 style="color: limegreen">ABIGAIL - WILDCAT - ANT HILL</h3> (9-12.2 mi):<br>
          <div class="trail-description">
            <h3>Parking:</h3> Park at the Birch Run site mentioned in the Rocky Knob description.
            <br>
            <h3>Route:</h3> This is a "Lollipop Loop", meaning the you complete the beginning section, make a loop, and hike the beginning in reverse. Luckily Dam Breast Access and Abigail trails which make up the "stick" of the lollipop are beautiful enough to be worth hiking twice. Starting at the Birch run lot, you can hike the dam breast access trail, which is not really marked, but pretty easy to follow. It parallels a road by the same name and follows the shore of Long Pine Run reservoir. At the end of this trail, you find yourself at the dam breast, which is interesting to hike out onto and see the man-made waterfall at the outlet of the reservoir. Abigail Trail is marked with a post and well mainted and blazed. It traverses northward up the lower extent of East Big Flat Ridge, looking back you get views of the reservoir as you climb away. After 2.2 miles, take a right at the intersection with EUB Camp Trail, which descends farily quickly off the ridge and varies from tight trail to a haul road. After about a mile, Abigail trail rejoins to the left, which can be taken to cut the hike down to less than 9 miles. A half mile later, Wildcat trail extends to the left. Wildcat climbs across and upp the ridge meeting a powerline cut-through, which you turn left and follow a small trail along for several hundred feet. Ant Hill Trail breaks off to the left and runs south to the summit of the ridge -- Strasbaugh Hill. Eventually, Ant Hill rejoins Abigail trail, where you turn right and follow a new portion back to the EUB/Abigail intersection, where you complete the Lollipop loop. The route back to the car is significantly easier as you descend the ridge back down to the dam.
