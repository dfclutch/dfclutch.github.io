					Revenue Streams
				</div>
				Above is a break down of where the money made by ESports athletes comes from. Like more traditional sports, most of the profit comes from advertising through sponsors. Just like how Michael Jordan or LeBron James have shoes with their names on them from Nike, top ESports athletes receive similar deals with companies for signature controllers, merchandise, etc.

					Continued Growth
				</div>
				Sponsorship money makes up around 40% of the $900 Million net worth of Esports.	However, as ESports becomes more widely viewed and the monetary potential increases, it is expected that media rights for Esports events will significantly increase the worth of Esports in the upcoming years.
