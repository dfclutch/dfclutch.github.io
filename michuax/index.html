      <h1>Recreation in the Michaux State Forest</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>
        The Michaux (Mih-show) State Forest is an 85,000 acre area covering the majority of South Mountain in Pennsylvania. The Michaux is culturally, historically, and geographically important. It is filled with cultural resources including remnents of the iron and logging industries and a key section of the Appalachian Trail. South Mountain (poorly named) represents the northern terminus of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a 600 mile chain which include the Smokies and the Shenandoah, stretching from here in southern PA to Georgia and comprising the easternmost extent of the Appalachian range. The Blue Ridge is distinct from the rest of the Appalachians in both geography/topology (the western portions of the Appalachians are mostly longe ridge-and-valley formations while the Blue Ridge has steeper, triangular peaks with shorter ridges), and culture (the Blue Ridge is more traditionally Appalachian). South Mountain forms a hook shape centered around Gettysburg. It is historically signficant in that it was the end of the "screen" the Blue Ridge provided the Confederate army during the Civil War. Once this screen ran out, the Confederates new they would no longer have the coverage and secrecy and moved east, meeting a small group of Union Calvary at Gettysburg. The Michaux is home to Penn State Mont Alto Campus, home to one of the finest and oldest forestry schools in the country. Because of this, the Michaux is home to many forestry experiments, which is why you often find dense pine plantations sharply divided from hardwood forests, and seemingly random fences (used to test the growth of trees without the presence of deer and bears). As with all the state forests, the Michaux is a "working forest", it is actively logged and used for other various environmental resources. The Michaux contains many weird things too. I've found burnt out cars, random shacks, there was a WWII Prisoner of War camp (unknown to the public until the '90s), countless unmarked trails that lead to deadends, etc. Don't get lost, bring plenty of water, some food, extra clothes, and do not expect cell service.

Cumberland Valley is to the west of the forest containing the towns of Chambersburg, Waynesboro, and Carlisle. The Piedmont region starts at the eastern edge of the mountain and extending to the Atlantic Ocean.</figcaption>
