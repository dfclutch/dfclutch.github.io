				<div class="content">My studies at Ohio State have focused mainly on learning the fundamental concepts of computer science. These include object-oriented programming techniques, data structures, proper documentation,  low-level programming, version control techniques, automated testing, and efficient algorithm design. The CSE department at Ohio State produces students who can ground-up build applications and systems that are easily maintained, well organized, and self-explanatory. Outside of my studies in the computer science department, Statistics has been a significant portion of my education at Ohio State. I have taken statistics courses covering inference and testing, spatial statistical methods, non-parametric testing, regression, dimensionality-reduction, and feature extraction. In my free time, I enjoy developing my front-end development skills, both in web and standalone application use cases. Building instantly comfortable and self-guiding interfaces is a central goal when I approach building an application. Because I like to consider myself and engineer first, I focus on learning about software development strategies and continually improving performance and efficiency.

				<div class="page-title">Personal</div>
				<div class="content">The middle child of three boys, I grew up around farms and orchards in rural southern PA. Few things are as important to me as spending time alone outside. I enjoy long distance running and will nerd out over ultralight backpacking gear for hours (check out my <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/6pw8l" class="in-text"> lighterpack</a>). Aside from walking and running in the woods, music has been a long-term passion of mine, beginning with guitar. After studying classical guitar for several years, among other instruments such as cello and piano, I have branched out into many different genres. From experimental hip hop to American Primitive Guitar (<a href="https://danfiller.bandcamp.com/releases" class="in-text">Listen!</a>) and modal jazz, I will play or listen to just about anything. Other hobbies of mine include drawing and painting, searching for the ultimate apple cider (it's from <a href="http://www.oylersorganicfarms.com/" class="in-text">Oyler's Organics</a> in Biglerville, PA), and looking at maps.
