                Since I forgot it was 2020 and not 2006 I decided to start a blog. There's a lot of blogs out there and
                I can't promise that this one will be anything special. By way of introduction, my name is Dan Filler
                and I am a software engineer
                specializing in frontend React/Redux apps. Personally, I think the CS blog culture is filled with
                terribly written, unhelpful blogs that only hurt new developers (not that there aren't exceptions, I'll
                compile a list eventually). I don't plan on writing a standard Medium blog about building todo apps in
                React. In fact, I don't plan on keeping this blog to even a majority of computer science-topics.

                I plan on this being a very impractical CS blog, when it is CS-focused. I do enough practical
                engineering at work, so when I think about Computer Science outside of work the last thing I want to
                consider is scalability, usefulness, or efficiency (except in theory). I am interested in discrete
                mathematics surrounding computation. My biggest interest is in computability/automata theory and it's
                intersection with information theory. These concepts also intersect highly with programming languages in
                both implementation and the underlying models that give them power. I enjoy graph theory and network
                science, particularly the algorithms used to compute properties. Although I specialized in Artificial
                Intelligence during undergrad (At Ohio State, GO BUCKS), I am not interested in machine learning. I find
                that AI techniques that involve training statistical models on massive data sets are unsatisfying and
                inelegant. Not that these techniques aren't powerful and successful, but I simply don't find them
                exciting.

                Outside of computer science, I have far too many interests to keep up with. One of my biggest interests
                is maps, geography, and topology. I like learning about places, the streets and neighborhoods of cities,
                the layout of the landscape, and the aesthetics of maps that record them. This is coupled with and
                interest of <em>Local History</em>. I was never very interested in major historic events, but I enjoy
                learning the history of towns (particularly the places I live) and how they have shifted and shaped.
                This is well matched with a love of hiking and running. I used to be terrible with directions until I
                started running in high school and using Google Earth to layout and measure runs. Hiking in the
                mountains (especially here in Utah) makes topology utterly real. It's one thing to see a 3000'
                continuous climb on a map and think "yeah, I can hike that" but really doing it is, well, not that
                straightforward.

                I am interested in design and architecture (however unsophisticated my knowledge of the field).
                Furniture design is something I am very interested in, and I follow at least 10 instagram pages devoted
                to extremely expensive mid-century furniture. I draw a lot, mostly landscapes and buildings in pen. If I
                had the resources, I would love to put together a wood and machine shop to design and build my own
                furniture. Some of my favorite architects include Rafael Vinoly, Peter Bohlin, and Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe. I
                like the furniture designs of Jean Prouve (of course, I don't care if it's basic), George Nakashima, and
                Cor Alons. My favorite artist has long been JWM Turner. I am also passively intersted in fashion. I have
                a massive collection of flannels, mostly from LL Bean, ranging from vintage american-made pieces to my
                yearly christmas gift flannel. I haven't put a lot of effort into my wardrobe recently, but I like to
                sit somewhere in the normcore to heritage techware to traditional Pennsylvania woodsman range. My
                favorite brands (that I cannot afford) include Gitman Vintage, Visvim, and Story MFG.

                The last of my major hobbies is music. I both appreciate and play music. My main outlet is through
                guitar, I mostly play <em>American Primitive Guitar</em>. This genre (pioneered in the late 50s by John
                Fahey) is focused around instrumental fingerstyle guitar. I tend to shift the standard "droning" style
                of the genre toward more melodic, bluegrass-inspired arrangements. I have rearranged several banjo or
                violin standards for the guitar, and I mostly play in open tunings. Currently, my main guitar is a 1954
                Silvertone 696. I listen to just about everything. Some of my favorite genres are bluegrass/old
                time/appalachian folk, jazz (mainly bebop), shoegaze, americana, glitch, minimalist composition, and
                noise rock. My all-time favorite band is Pavement. Other artists I love are (in somewhat descending
                order): The Microphones/Mount Eerie, Parquet Courts, Fennesz, Townes Van Zandt, Songs: Ohia (and other
                Jason Molina projects), Max Roach, Animal Collective, Ellen Arkbro, Phillip Glass, Madvillian, Kendrick
                Lamar, Frank Ocean, and Yung Lean.

                I don't have much of a plan for this blog. I enjoy writing and talking about things I care about. I also
                enjoy teaching and explaining. I often find myself writing things down with no real end, other than just
                to get out the need to explain them. So, the goal of this page is simply to be a place to express that
                need. I have a number of ideas for posts that I would like to make, mostly centered around computer
                science. Here's a list I can think of off the top of my head (partially for my own reference):
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementing literal Neural Networks in JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Ideas on an JSON structured programming language</li>
                    <li>An information theoretic look at JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, and other structured data containers
                    </li>
                    <li>Architectures for Vanilla JS + HTML Canvas animation</li>
                    <li>Compression algorithms</li>
                    <li>Node- and global-level graph measures and a novel method for measuring them against each other
                    </li>
                    <li>Existing and Novel methods of random graph generation</li>
                    <li>RFC, TBL, HTTP a.k.a. the history and essence of the internet</li>
                    <li>Implementing an analog synth with the Web Audio API</li>
                </ul>

                Topics not relating to CS:

                <ul>
                    <li>The growth of Gettysburg, PA as a function of Battlefield protected land</li>
                    <li>Compiled list of great Chairs, Desks</li>
                    <li>Houses of the Victorian and German Villages of Columbus, Ohio.</li>
                    <li>National Park Rustic architecture</li>
                    <li>Graphing the SadBoys, Uncle Tupelo, and other splintering groups</li>
                </ul>

                That's probably it for this post. I'm hoping to write a couple of posts a month. Some will require a lot
                more work than others, particularly ones that require programming efforts. Stay tuned and see what
                happens!
