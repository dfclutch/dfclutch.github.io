                Out of all restaurants, I've easily eaten at Chipotle 2-3 times as many as the next most frequent. I fear I've spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars at Chipotle restaurants during high school, college, and in my time since. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_burrito">Mission Burrito</a> is one of my all time favorite foods, even if it is an example of food gentrification at it's worst.

                One distinguishing factor of Chipotle over any other restaurant is it's interior design. The restaurant is plainly different from any other major restaurant chain in it's design. The industrial look stretches back to the second location, opened in Denver, when founder Steve Ells brought in an architect. Concrete floors, exposed duct work, stainless steel, birch CDX plywood, and white tile are the primary materials. When assembled, the restaurant feels authentic, high-quality, welcoming, and one of Chipotle's key brand identifiers: transparent.

                The current iteration of Chipotle's interior design language was refined in 2007 by <a href="http://www.architectureoutfit.com/">Architecture Outfit</a>. While the exact design of each franchise location is left up to the franchisee, the firm put together a "kit of parts" and a set of guidelines to provide cohesion across locations. One of the most interesting influences on the design was Mies Van Der Rohe's <a href="https://farnsworthhouse.org/">Farnsworth House</a>. The house is composed from a glass facade and plywood "core volume" containing the kitchen, bathroom and fireplace.

                The design influence here is clear, and referenced in AO's project page on the <a href="http://www.architectureoutfit.com/eating#/chipotle">Chipotle Re-Wrap</a>. Chipotle restaurants adopted the large plywood mass, often housing drink stations, bathroom entrances, and separators between the dining area and kitchen. The transparency of the Farnsworth house's glass exterior is also mirrored by the restaurant. Diners can see almost everything the chefs do.

                A much older aspect of Chipotle design is the chair:

            </Figure>
            <p>
                The chair is a surprisingly excellent piece of design for a mass produced piece of fast-casual restaurant furniture. The Chipotle Wikipedia article, and most information available, incorrectly references only Bruce Gueswel as the designer of the chair. However, it has a much lengthier history than that. The basis of the design was a set of dining chairs made for Frank Lloyd Wright's Seth Peterson Cottage.

            <p>
                These chairs were made of plywood and contribute to a motif of furniture designs by FLW which extends to the tables, lounge chairs around the fireplace, and several other pieces of furniture from Wright's portfolio.

                Bruce Gueswel (the man often referenced as the designer of the Chipotle chair) built a copy of this chair that became the model for the <a href="http://www.oixio.com/habitat-solutions/form/form-chair.html"><em>for<u>m</u> chair</em></a> designed by the true creator, Steve Sauer. Sauer was the designer who took the plywood leg pieces of the original FLW chair and redesigned them in skeletal, galvanized steel. The chair was also designed with a wider base, making it more stable. The chair's name is stylized as for<u>m</u>, as seen on Sauer's webpage and the stamp he created to mark them.

                These chairs were put into production for the first 7 Chipotle locations, with a run of 244 examples. The chairs were quite noisy, so Steven Sell (Chipotle Founder) asked Sauer to design feet to quite them. At this point, Gueswel took over the design and manufacture of the chairs, adding feet and rubber components under the seatpan. The key difference between the modern Chipotle chair and the original for<u>m</u> chair is the shape of the skeletal legs. The current chair dropped the central convergence of all four legs in the center of the chair for two separate leg components connected in the front and back by cross struts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chairs continue to be manufactured and used in every Chipotle location as a key feature of the restaurant. Perhaps those less interested in chairs than myself fail to notice them, but I urge you, the next time you are in a Chipotle, to take a look at the chairs. They are a great piece of design steeped in architectural and furniture design history and reference.
