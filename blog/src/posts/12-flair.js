    Finally something I'm actually qualified to talk about: making espresso on the Flair manual lever system.

      <p>
        The Flair is a manual espresso press. Espresso is just hot water forced through finely ground coffee at a certain pressure, so it's actually pretty easy to do by hand. The giant espresso machines are mostly just hot water tanks and pumps. Instead, with the Flair, you heat the water manually and provide the pressure yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic components of the Flair are the stand, the water chamber, and the filter. The filter fits snugly into the water chamber and both sit on the stand.
      </p>
      <p>You heat up the water chamber ahead of time to ensure temperature stability, if you put boiling water in a cold stainless steel tube it will drop in temperature rapidly.</p>

      It all starts with boiling some water in my (busted) kettle.

      Once the water boils, I fill the base of a moka pot with the boiling
      water, and bring it back to a boil over my smallest burner. I use the
      single-size moka pot for this application.

      While the moka pot comes to a boil, I lay out all my accoutrements in the
      ready position.

      Here's where we use the moka pot: I place the portafilter over the moka
      pot to warm it up (read: get it burning hot) while I do the next few prep
      steps.

      Fill my milk pitcher (actually a French Press) and place over near the
      microwave. I can eyeball the amount of milk for a single cortado pretty
      easily after making a few hundred of them.

      Weigh out the beans. 18.1g, close enough!

      Set the portafilter in it's place on the Flair. This both pulls heat out
      of the portafilter (I don't want the ground beans to come in contact with
      the super hot metal) and warms the copper mount, increasing the thermal
      stability later.

      Place the brew chamber and shower screen on the moka pot to heat up. This
      is the most important use of the moka pot. Getting this chamber VERY hot
      means that the brew water will stay right around the 200&deg; during
      brewing.

      Remove and dry the portafilter and use the funnel and dosing cup (both
      come with the Flair) to fill. At this point, the portafilter is just warm
      to the touch.

        Let's recap: We've gotten everything warmed up to temp, prepped our
        milk, prepped our beans and are ready to brew some espresso. The kettle
        is full of still warm water, which we need to boil and immediately when
        it boils, get it into the Flair and pulling through the coffee as
        quickly as possible. We also want our milk hot and ready to froth right
        away as well. The next series of moves must happen quickly in the exact
        order for the best results.
      </p>
      <p>The timer starts when we press the boil button on our kettle.</p>

      Get the milk in the microwave and punch in the time - but don't start it.
      I've been known to microwave things for very exact times. On my current
      microwave thats 36s for a cortado's worth of milk.

      Carefully pickup the shower screen off the moka pot, dry it, and place it
      on top of the coffee. Do the same with the brew chamber (though it doesn't
      need to be dried). I do these in two separate trips to the stovetop
      because it's too hard to hold 2 pieces of boiling hot metal at once.

      Right as I finish getting the brew chamber on, the water has finished
      boiling. Quickly, but accurately, fill the brew chamber. It's easy to
      over-pour, spill down the sides, etc. so just don't do that. After it's
      filled, I immeadiately place the plunger at the ready and then start the
      microwave.

      Start pulling the shot! On the Flair I usually do "Slayer" style shots -
      which means long, low pressure start and then slowly ramp up to a medium
      pressure (~6 bar) extraction. Generally I aim for 18g in, 40g out.

      Pull the remaining water from the brew chamber into a second glass. This
      makes cleanup easier and less dangerous later.

      No pictures, but I froth the warmed milk in the french press by rapidly pumping the screen up and down. Warm milk will hold air easily, I start with a few big pumps to incorporate a good amount of air and then do many small, quick pumps to mix the frothy milk and the non-frothy warm milk. Then I transfer to a warmed milk pitcher. The spout on the stainless steel pitcher is much better for pouring milk, and the pouring action when I transfer the milk is a good mixing step.

      The completed cortado. A cortado is my drink of choice, you can still enjoy the main flavors of the espresso clearly, but in a rich, frothy, sweet milk drink. This glass is known as the Libbey Gibraltar glass, which gives this drink it's other name: the Gibraltar.
