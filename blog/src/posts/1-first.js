      <p>Howdy, folks!</p>
      <p>
        I'm Dan, I'm a software engineer living in Columbus, OH. I build
        frontend apps for a salestech company in React. Originally, I had an
        idea for a Computer Science/Software Engineering blog, and I still may
        write a few articles in that space, but most of the things I want to
        write about are architecture/design focused. Specifially, Columbus area
        architecture, architects, neighborhoods, etc. I like furniture design
        and history, so that will make an appearance. I also make a lot of
        coffee, so I may do a manual espresso work flow explanation, talk
        through experiments, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have any qualifications to write about such things. I just read
        stuff on the internet. I will be loosely citing my sources, but that
        will often be Wikipedia.
