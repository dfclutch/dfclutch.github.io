        The Allegheny Front Trail is a roughly 40 mile backpacking loop in
        north-central Pennsylvania. I decided last minute to go on a three-day
        trip to hike it. This was my first time hiking the AFT, though I have
        completed several other backpacking loops and many trips to the
        north-central PA area. Highlights include the red-stained Moshannon
        creek, views from the Allegheny front, plentiful blueberries, and open
        meadow sections.
      </p>
      <h2>The AFT</h2>
      <p>
        The AFT is a relatively new construction, made up of much older routes.
        It came about in the late 1990's as a result of the efforts of Ralph
        Seeley - a legendary trail maintainer and historian in the region - and
        other volunteers from the DCNR and local trail clubs. The trail exists
        fully within the Moshannon state forest, linking together existing trail
        systems, old railroad grades and logging roads, and ancient American
        Indian trails.
      </p>
      <p>
        The AFT is one of the easiest backpacking loops in Pennsylvania as far
        as elevation gain and general terrain are concerned. It averages only
        +/- 134'/mile as opposed to something like the Black Forest Trail that
        averages +/- 205'/mile. The largest single climb, out of the Moshannon
        creek canyon, is about 720' over 2 miles. While a bit overgrown in July,
        the trail is well maintained with bridges over most wet crossings,
        frequent blazes, and generally well graded trail. Thankfully, stinging
        nettle is not nearly as prevalent here compared to other trails in PA.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail encircles Black Moshannon state park, which contains the
        namesake Black Moshannon lake and the boggy wetlands that surround it.
        The Moshannon creek - aka the "Red Mo" or "Cancer Creek", is a major
        waterway that borders the northern edge of the loop. This creek is
        stained bright orange-red due to acidic pollution from old mining
        operations in the upper watershed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I hiked, I followed along in the official guidebook -{" "}
        <em>Guide to the Allegheny Front Trail</em> - by Ben Cramer. I love
        these guidebooks, they add an immersive layer to the trip with context
        and history as well as practical info on camping, wildlife, and water
        quality.
      </p>
      <h2>Geography</h2>
      <p>
        The trail's namesake - The Allegheny Front - is a major geographical
        dividing line in the Appalachian region. The front separates the
        Ridge-and-valley province to the east from the Allegheny Plateau to the
        west. Unfortunately, the trail only skirts along the edge of the front
        for 2 miles, providing gorgeous, but short-lived, views. The remainder
        of the trail weaves through the hollows and across the top of the
        plateau just behind the front.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ridge-and-valley province is comprised of long, narrow, steep-sided
        ridges rippling across rolling valleys of farm land 1000' below. These
        ridges are more apparent and distinct in PA than any other Appalachian
        state, clearly visible from satellite imagery and geological maps. Blue
        Mountain is a particularly consistent and long ridge, running 200 miles
        from the Maryland line in central PA up to New Jersey in the
        north-eastern corner of the state. Blue Mountain is effectively the
        eastern border of the ridge-and-valley - the Allegheny Front being the
        western border.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Allegheny Plateau, the largest province of the Appalachian
        mountains, is a <em>Dissected Plateau</em> stretching from central New
        York down to Kentucky and Tennessee where it is called the Cumberland
        Plateau. The top of the plateau is quite consistent in elevation, about
        2000' in this area. When you are on the top of the plateau and can view
        across it, it can at times appear to be a flat plain. Over millennia,
        water has carved out deep hollows, forming a dense network of rippling
        hills. These are sort of "inverse" mountains, as they were not lifted up
        themselves, rather land around them was carved away. Culturally, the
        "hills 'n hollers" that make up the plateau are the truest and deepest
        parts of the Appalachians, particularly in West Virginia, Kentucky, and
        Tennessee.
      </p>

      <h2>Trip Report</h2>
      <h3>Day 1</h3>
      <p>
        I arrived at the trailhead at about 9:45am on Friday, July, 21. I
        decided to start my hike at the intersection of PA 504 and Sixmile Run,
        the western side of the loop. Starting here allowed me to hike along the
        Allegheny Front during the second day of the trip so I could take my
        time at each vista. This also meant I had nearly 17 miles to hike on the
        first day to get to a good campsite.
      </p>
      <Figure

      />
      <p>
        I'm very picky about campsites, selecting the right one is important for
        a comfortable night and next day. In PA - and the rest of the eastern US
        - I almost always prefer to camp at higher elevations. Atop the plateau,
        the air is dry (and warmer in the winter) with good airflow and fewer
        bugs. Unfortunately, most established campsites on these PA trails are
        along streams deep down in valleys so water is readily available. I get
        around the need for water by cooking my dinner with a few miles
        remaining for the day and filling up on water before my last climb up to
        camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I set off around 10am heading north along Sixmile run. Rain from the
        night before and that morning was hanging around on the leaves, so I was
        fairly wet even though it wasn't actively precipitating. After hiking
        about 10 minutes I realized I had left a banana in the truck I had
        planned to eat on the way up. I made the decision to stash my pack and
        jog back to grab it so I wouldn't have to stress about a bear smelling
        it and ripping my truck's doors off.
      </p>

      <p>
        The trail along Sixmile was gorgeous, snaking right alongside the creek
        through hemlock groves, blooming rhododendron, and squeezing between
        boulders. I passed the remnants of two man-made stone structures - a
        livestock stable and a partial dam for the Plumbe forge - from the
        logging era.

      <p>
        After about 3 miles hiking north, the trail climbs and turns east to
        follow the Moshannon creek. As I descended back toward the bottom of the
        canyon, the bright orange creek started to peek through the forest. The
        sun started to appear a bit during this section and the rain of the
        previous night must have stirred up more of the orange-colored silt from
        the creek bed, giving the water an opaque Fanta-orange color.
      </p>

        The trail closely follows Moshannon for the next 3.5 miles, only once
        climbing away from the creek up the side of the canyon near Sawdust
        hollow. At the top of that vigorous climb is a fantastic campsite that I
        plan to use in the future. There are several water sources along the
        trail within a mile of either side of the climb, and the camp is far
        enough out of the canyon to avoid most of the humidity and bugs. Near
        the camp is a small vista up the Moshannon creek canyon.
      </p>

        caption="Camp at sawdust hollow"
      />
      <p>
        As the trail nears the I-80 viaduct over the Moshannon, It turns sharply
        right and climbs 720' up to the top of the plateau. The climb is
        relatively difficult for the first mile but tapers off toward the top.
        There is supposed to be a vista near the top of the climb, and perhaps I
        missed it by not looking back enough, but I think it has just been
        overgrown. May be better in the winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time atop the plateau is short-lived. As soon as the climbing stops,
        the trail descends again, this time to the bottom of the hollow carved
        by Black Moshannon creek. This creek is a tributary to the Red Mo - but
        stained like black tea from decaying plant material in the bogs that
        form it's upper watershed. The Black Mo' is crossed twice during this
        hike, on opposite sides of the loop, before and after flowing through
        Black Moshannon lake. This time we are crossing after flowing out of the
        lake as it continues to weave it's way north toward the Red Mo and
        ultimately to the West Branch Susquehanna.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail continues along the bottom of the hollow following the Black
        Moshannon at first, turning right to cross the stream on a
        well-constructed bridge near an old hunting cabin and then continuing
        along Benner Run. There are several nice camps in this area, though they
        are too low-lying and swampy for me to spend the night at. I stopped at
        the camp along Benner run to eat my main meal for the day - a Packit
        Gourmet trailside bean and cheese burrito, basically taco bell on the
        trail. This camp is large and open with flat ground and good soft ground
        cover.

      <p>
        Along Benner run is one of the thickest stretches of rhododendron tunnel
        I've ever seen. At one point the trail drops into a black hole where
        rhodos totally encase the hiker. Benner run, only 10' to the right, is
        invisible and can only be heard. A classic AFT landmark appears next:
        Mary's Window. A perfectly cleared hole in rhododendron framing a view
        of a small waterfall along Benner.

        The trail climbs out of the Black Mo/Benner run hollow for the last
        major climb of the day - only 550'. As the trail tops-out on the
        Plateau, it enters a vast area of blueberry bushes. In July many were
        ripe and they were large and sweet. They continue to surround the trail
        for most of the time it spends on top of the plateau.

        The remaining 5 miles of the day rolled by, climbing in and out of more
        gentle hollows formed by Hall and Rock runs. Toward the end of the day,
        the trail intersects and follows the Rock Run Trail System - a precursor
        to the AFT that was built for cross-country skiing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I arrived at my intended campsite along the upper headwaters of Middle
        Branch rock run in a section of open forest with dense blueberry ground
        cover. The headwaters are just a trickle buried under thick foliage, but
        it is still spanned by a small bridge. The campsite was large enough for
        2 maybe 3 tents max, but was nice and flat and perfectly situated on the
        top of the plateau in a small depression.

      <h3>Day 2</h3>
      <p>
        The next morning I took my time getting out of camp. I was in no rush as
        I only had 15 miles to hike all day, when the previous day I had hiked
        16 after driving up. I've been drinking instant coffee from a local
        Columbus, OH roaster - Brioso - and greatly enjoying it. In fact, after
        a few years of trying different instant and non-instant methods of doing
        coffee on-trail I had almost given up and resigned to just not drinking
        it on trips. However I tried Brioso and it is absolutely fantastic. It's
        fairly expensive, but definitely worth it for short trips.
      </p>
      <p>
        The morning brought beautiful clear-blue skies and easy hiking for the
        first several miles. I passed through several nice meadows full of ferns
        and blueberries walled-in by thick spruce. Further on, the trail follows
        some old logging roads, a common choice for trail builders.
      </p>
      <Figure

        breakpoints={[{ w: Infinity, v: "60%" }]}
      />
      <p>
        The trail rolls gently up to the highest elevation of the AFT (2405')
        shortly before crossing over PA 504 again, 7 miles east of where I had
        parked. This crossing is the main trailhead with a sign for the AFT -
        sadly no paper maps were available, I like to take these for my
        collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail continues to descend, reaching the edge of the Allegheny Front
        at an elevation of roughly 2200'. The trail curves southwest beginning
        to trace the general edge of the Front for the next 2 miles. Here, the
        trail also intersects and follows some ancient trails including remnants
        of a Native American trail called The Great Shamokin Path that continues
        all the way off the edge of the plateau deep into the valley below.
      </p>
      <p>
        The views start to open up a bit and glimpses into Bald Eagle valley and
        beyond start appearing. It becomes apparent that the whole trail so far
        has been at relatively high elevation on the plateau - even when down in
        deep hollows - and that the real "bottom" of the plateau is a full 1600'
        below. Luckily (or unfortunately if you're a glutton for pain), we won't
        be dropping fully off the plateau at any point.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a bit of climbing and descent, a major vista opens up at the top
        of Whetstone Hollow. The two ridges that frame the view are the
        fragmented edges of the plateau, beyond those are small foothills, then
        the deep Bald Eagle Valley backed by Bald Eagle Mountain. Hiding from
        view is Nittany Valley - home of State College, PA and Penn State, then
        far in the distance peeking out is Tussey Mountain.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        I only stuck around Whetstone for a few minutes before moving on. I
        passed a decent campsite with no vista nearby before arriving at my
        lunch spot - a wonderful campsite with a gorgeous vista. The vista looks
        almost directly east, oblique to the direction of the front. The
        campsite is relatively large and nicely flattened. I found a nice
        titanium tent stake in the ground - in fact I almost stepped on it in
        bare feet - which will do nicely as a backup. A similar set of features
        to the first vista - farms in the Bald Eagle foothills, Bald Eagle and
        Tussey Mountains in the distance.

      <p>
        Up next are two classic AFT landmarks, <em>Ralph's Pretty Good View</em>{" "}
        and <em>Ralph's Majestic Vista</em>. The "Ralph" in question here is
        Ralph Seeley, mentioned above, who inspired and produced the trail. Due
        to overgrowth, the Pretty Good View is actually a much better and more
        open vista. In fact, I didn't even bother to take a pic of the Majestic
        Vista other than the sign with the vista in the background.

      <p>
        Immediately after the Majestic Vista, the trail "turns it's back to the
        Front" and climbs about 100' up over the edge onto the plateau. Just as
        the trail crests the top it winds through a large rock outcropping I
        have deemed the "Nose of the Allegheny Front". The rocks are stratified
        and heavily eroded. The outcropping appears relatively small compared to
        other ridge-side boulder fields in the state, though I didn't look to
        see if/how far it continues across the corner of the front.

      <p>
        The trail descends and climbs and descends again into the hollow formed
        by Smay's Run. The trail threads through a u-bend in a small creek with
        a large campsite. The site is surrounded on three sides by water making
        it nearly impossible to camp here legally due to the requirement that
        campsites be 100' from open water. I stopped here to rest and eat some
        lunch.

      <p>
        Soon, the trail enters the Black Moshannon state park where it
        intersects with the Moss-Hanne trail for a few miles. This section is
        known for marsh crossings with boardwalks where the trail would
        otherwise be underwater. You also enter the first of what will become a
        common site for much of the rest of the trip: white pine plantations.

        The trail makes the second crossing over Black Moshannon creek on Shirks
        road, nearby a sign describes a Native American trail. I made one final
        stop took cook dinner a few miles later at the camp along a stream near
        Clay Mine Road, this stream is an upper fork of Black Moshannon creek.

        After a lengthy section of pipeline walking, the trail turns sharply
        right into the upper Sixmile Run hollow. Shortly after, I made camp at a
        site along the creek in a dark hemlock grove. Not my preferred style of
        campsite, but it ended up being fine. There was a powerful spring up the
        trail a few hundred feet that provided delicious and cold water.

        As I was drifting off to sleep, I thought I could hear music playing in
        the distance, but decided it was just forest noise. Then, I hear loud
        and clear "You! shook me all night long!" and realized it was music,
        distorted and echoed up the hollow from an unknown locale. The music
        persisted a few minutes, followed but loud bangs that I initially
        thought were gunshots but soon realized they were fireworks. My mind
        played tricks on itself thinking they were coming closer and plotting
        how I'd get out of the tent and where I'd hide if a band of ruffians
        were to come through my camp site looking for trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of those things happened of course and I fell asleep after a few
        minutes, drained from the 31 miles I covered over the previous 2 days.

      <h3>Day 3</h3>
      <p>
        I woke up to a chilly July morning in the hemlocks with bright sunlight
        piercing through a light fog. I was looking to get back to the car by
        noon so I was moving quickly and had broken camp by 7:30. The trail
        continued to weave through hemlock groves along Sixmile run for the
        first part of the day.

        The final major landmark came to pass: Wolf Rock's. Just a bit of
        overhanging rock outcropping right next to Horse Hollow/Sixmile Run
        Road. I didn't even stop to try for a decent pic, other than to document
        the absolutely crazy amount of animal droppings under the ledge.

        Later, the trail traces the edge then weaves through a massive red pine
        plantation. This plantation covers several hundred acres and was planted
        in the 30's by the Civilian Conservation Corps. A few norway spruce are
        mixed in.

        I was pleased to see one last giant hemlock before arriving back at the
        car. I made it back around 11am after 7.4 miles of hiking.

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        Physically, I felt great on this hike. I didn't push the mileage very
        hard and took my time each day. I think my food planning has really
        improved over the last few trips. I've been focusing on getting a higher
        percentage of my calories from fat, upping protein, and reducing sugar.
        Dark chocolate is great for candy cravings, while having the benefit of
        low sugar and a much higher melting point than milk chocolate.
      </p>

        No major gear failures here either. I recently picked up a Klymit
        inflatable sleeping pad with insulation, that is somehow lighter than
        the other Klymit inflatable I had without insulation. This pad works
        great, and is especially comfortable paired with a section of z-style
        foam pad.

        The AFT was an enjoyable hike, though nothing special as far as PA
        backpacking trails are concerned. The views are few and condensed to one
        area. It was short and had little elevation gain, making it a perfect
        beginner backpacking trip, or a good way to get warmed up if you haven't
        been out for a while. For me, it made a nice summer trip, where I didn't
        have to crush multiple 1000' climbs per day when it's 85&deg; out. I saw
        only 2 other people the whole trip - a pair of day hikers near Smay's
        run camp. There is definitely solitude out there.
